Put the freesurfer folders and files in this folder for the given version.

You should have folders such as: mri, scripts, surf, etc.

If you have freesurfer installed physically somewhere else, then make links to its folders here.

Command to do that would look something like, assuming you are running it from inside this folder:

ln -s <full path to where your freesurfer is installed>/* .
