#	Pipeline Parameters for P2
#	If variables are defined in the login script
#	of a user, these will override them for
#	the current execution
#	Generally this file will remain empty.
#	If you want to override what the pipeline
#	environment sets variables to, for some reason,
#	you can set variables here. This is called at the
#	start of P2.
#	You should ONLY mess with this if you know what you are doing!

#and the study parameters. Other than the file structures, these modules will
#not be aware of any other variables that are not environment variables.
