# R2 star mapping

## Introduction

Welcome to **R2starmapping**. **R2starmapping** is a tool providing a graphical user interface for R2* (1/T2*) mapping from multi-echo GRE data in Matlab.

The aim of this toolbox is to provide and simplify the usage of different R2* mapping algorithms. 

This toolbox is freely available for educational and research purposes. 

If you have any question/suggestion regarding this toolbox, please free feel to contact me by k.chan@donders.ru.nl.

## Installation

To use **R2starmapping** , just add the directory containing r2starGUI.m to your MATLAB PATH.

This can be done by:
'Set Path' -> 'Add Folder' -> /your/r2starmapping/directory/ -> 'Save'  

or with MATLAB's command: `addpath('/your/r2starmapping/directory/')`  

After that, you can start the GUI by entering `r2starGUI` in the MATLAB's command window.

## Input data format

**R2starmapping** requires 4D NIfTI multi-echo GRE data (.nii and .nii.gz). To provide echo time (TE) information, **R2starmapping** accepts MAT file with variable named 'TE', which contains 1D array of all TEs related to the data (unit of second). You can also use the text file generated by [MRIConvert](https://lcni.uoregon.edu/downloads/mriconvert) as the TE file input. Alternatively, you can manually enter the TEs in the field provided in the GUI.
