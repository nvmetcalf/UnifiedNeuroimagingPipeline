8/4/2016 (caterina):
I'm storing in here information relevant for making the expanded set of 264 regions, with improved:
- basal ganglia (DG)
- thalamus (DG)
- cerebellum (BS - these are not as fully described)
8 mm instead of 10mm ROIs for these

We may also want to add coordinates for:
- hippocampus
- amygdala
- nucleus accumbens

Note:
- removed original BG and cerebellum nodes and replaced with new
- also removed the following nodes that were in the cerebellum: 11, 17, 23, 139

11/15/16 (fran);
This set of 298 ROIs is basically 209 ROIs from the previous BigBrain264 set
plus 28 ROIs with names that start with roi_D8mm from Deanna Greene's
cerebellar set and an additional 27 ROIs with names that start with
potentialROIs_updated_711 from Caterina Gratton's set.
All of the files in this directory have been consolidated from
/data/cn5/caterina/Atlases/PowerSpheres_expanded with the
BigBrain298_roilist.txt file modified to reflect the fact that the shared ROI
image files are now stored in /data/cn5/networkAnalysis/IndividualROIimages.
